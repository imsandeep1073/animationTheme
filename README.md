## Key Features Explained

### Gradient Text Effects
The hero section uses CSS gradients with `-webkit-background-clip: text` to create the colorful text effect.

### Parallax Scrolling
JavaScript calculates scroll position and applies transforms to create depth effects.

### Intersection Observer
Used for performance-optimized scroll animations that trigger when elements enter the viewport.

### Glassmorphism
Navigation and cards use `backdrop-filter: blur()` with semi-transparent backgrounds.

### Responsive Design
CSS Grid and Flexbox with media queries ensure the site works on all screen sizes.

## Browser Compatibility
